##### *a modern remix of the Berkley Copwatch Database*

## /blockchain
The **blockchain** repo is the code that gets published to the blockchain, and operates as an app that stores and retrieves data.

This "smart contract" is written in the Solidity language as is meant to be published to an Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible blockchain. Currently Polygon/MATIC is the target blockchain due to low cost per transactions.

The application is globally accessible from a community of thousands of servers and the data is immutable. So the public copwatch data that is stored in a location that can never be tampered with and never be taken down. Even if the website implodes and the IPFS mirrors all fail, anyone from anywhere can still read the public data.
